It returned the computed bytes as a Buffer, not the Scrypt Hash Format (`c2NyeXB0`) string with included metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    npm install js-scrypt\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    var scrypt = require('js-scrypt');\r\n\r\n    //asynchronous\r\n    scrypt.hash(password, salt [,options], callback);\r\n\r\n    //synchronous\r\n    var resultBuffer = scrypt.hashSync(password, salt [,options])\r\n\r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\n * `password` (String or Buffer) -  the value to be encoded/\r\n   * String will be encoded to bytes as UTF-8.\r\n   * Buffer will be encoded as-is.\r\n * `salt` (String or Buffer) - random data to be included in the hash.\r\n   * String will be encoded to bytes as UTF-8.\r\n   * Buffer will be encoded as-is.\r\n * `options` (Object, optional)\r\n   * `maxmem` (Integer, optional) - the total memory available for scrypt in megabytes\r\n     * default: 32\r\n     * allowed values are (4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048)\r\n   * `cost` (Integer, optional) - (N) must be a power of two, will set the overall difficulty of the computation.\r\n     * default: 16384 - Math.pow(2,14)\r\n     * min: Math.pow(2,8) - 256\r\n     * max: Math.pow(2,64) - 18446744073709552000\r\n     * Math.pow(2,14) - the scrypt paper's suggestion for interactive logins\r\n     * Math.pow(2,20) - the scrypt paper's suggestion for filesystem encryption\r\n   * `blockSize` (Integer, optional) - (r) blocksize to use\r\n     * default: 8\r\n     * min: 1\r\n     * max: 256\r\n   * `parallel` (Integer, optional) - (p) parallelization factor\r\n     * default: 1 (given the runtime environment, it is probably best to leave this as-is)\r\n     * min: 1\r\n     * max: 256\r\n   * `size` (Integer, optional) - (L) length of result (number of bytes to generate)\r\n     * default: 64 (this is a 512bit result, which is plenty for general password usage)\r\n     * min: 1\r\n     * max: 2048\r\n * `callback` (Function) - function(err, resultBuffer)\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n * Create method(s) to simulate time/memory computation of Nrp vectors which will return a `c2NyeXB0` Scrypt Hash Format string.\r\n \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nnode-js-scrypt is written by Michael J.
